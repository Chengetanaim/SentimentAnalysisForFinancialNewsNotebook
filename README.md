# SentimentAnalysisForFinancialNewsNotebook
Building the model of a financial news sentiment classifier.  Financial news headlines will be classified as positive, negative or neutral (from an investor point of view)

Open the SentimentAnalysisForFinancialNews.ipynb file. The file is where the code is but it's also a tutorial where I take you in the data science journey of data wrangling, feature engineering, eda and model building.
You can open the file right here in your browser.<br>
I also created a web application for this model using Django, the code for this can be found here - https://github.com/Chengetanaim/SentimentAnalysisForFinancialNews
